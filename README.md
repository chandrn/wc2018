# wc2018

A simple webapp to keep track of worldcup 2018 fixtures, results and standings.

Made possible thanks to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) and [openfootball](https://github.com/openfootball/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
